Abstract
========

Proposes a standard format for repository metadata for Open edX projects.

Motivation
==========

One of the primary goals for Best Practice OEPs is to standardize techniques
and tools across Open edX repositories. However, without
tooling, it will be difficult to move all of the repositories in the same
direction (and hard to validate which ones have been updated). This OEP exists
to fill that gap.  By providing a standard format for metadata about accordance
to Best Practice OEPs, tools can be developed in the future to report on the
current status of all of the Open edX repositories, and how well they follow
the Best Practices listed in the OEPs.

Bear in mind that particular classes of Open edX repositories may have
different Best Practices. The practices that apply to an XBlock may not be the
same as those that apply to a standalone Django service or to a Django app.

Specification
=============

Each repo in the Open edX system will include a file ``openedx.yaml``, with the
following fields:

``owner``: string
    The github user/team responsible for the repository.

``nick``: string
    A short-name for the repository used by reporting tools.

``tags``: list of strings
    Used to group repositories by in reporting tools. Sample tags: core,
    mobile analytics.

``oeps``: dictionary
    A list of keys corresponding to Best Practice OEPs (in the format
    ``oep-n``). Each value would be one of ``True``, ``False``, or a
    reason dictionary. ``True`` and ``False`` would indicate accordance (or
    lack thereof) with the specified OEP. A reason dictionary
    must have ``state`` and ``reason`` keys. The ``state`` key is a boolean,
    and ``reason`` is a string that should explain why it's ok that the
    ``state`` is ``False`` (this will be displayed in reporting tools).

    If an OEP isn't listed in the ``oeps`` dictionary, then it is assumed to be
    ``False``, unless the reporting tool can auto-detect accordance.

For example, in the `edx-platform`_ repo, the file might look like:

.. _edx-platform: https://github.com/edx/edx-platform

.. code-block:: yaml

    # openedx.yaml

    ---
    owner: edx/teaching-and-learning
    nick: edx
    tags:
        - core
        - xblock
        - lms
        - studio
    oeps:
        oep-314: True  # edx-platform uses django 3.14
        oep-42:
            state: False
            reason: This OEP doesn't actually exist


Rationale
=========

The keys in ``openedx.yml`` were derived from existing repository metadata collected
by edx.org.

The design of the ``oeps`` dictionary was guided by a couple of use cases:

1. Adding a new OEP that few repositories will support, initially. We shouldn't
   need to update all repositories to detect if they are in accordance, we should
   be able to assume that they aren't, or automatically detect whether they are.
2. Repositories may have specific requirements that force them to not implement a
   best practice. The tools should be able to present that reasoning to anyone
   looking across repositories, and the reasons should be documented in the repositories
   themselves.
3. As much as possible, Best Practices should be autodetected, but because they will
   often involve a judgement call, autodetection shouldn't be mandatory.
